# This script performs the following operations:
# 1. Downloads the Cifar10 dataset
# 2. Trains a CifarNet model on the Cifar10 training set.
# 3. Evaluates the model on the Cifar10 testing set.
#
# Usage:
# cd slim
# ./scripts/train_cifarnet_on_cifar10.sh
set -e

# Where the checkpoint and logs will be saved to.
TRAIN_DIR=~/tmp/cifarnet-model

# Where the dataset is saved to.
DATASET_DIR=~/tmp/cifar10

# Run evaluation.
